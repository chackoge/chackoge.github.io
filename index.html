    Annoyingly neurotypical. Lives off spinal reflexes. Questions authority respectfully. Recommends trust with verification. Has worked in government, industry, and academia. Decidedly
    sceptical about the value of shared governance in academia. Frowns on science tourism- the mechanism by which researchers indulge and subsidize their food, travel, and social interests through attending scientific conferences. 
    Present interests are (in no particular order) research funding, research evaluation, scientometrics, peer
    review, accountability in taxpayer-funded research, research integrity, and graph analytics. Call signs: KD9NEU and WRVI594

 on a cold wet morning in Champaign.

"The idea that science can and should be run according to some fixed rules, and that its rationality consists in 
 agreement with such rules, is both unrealistic and vicious. It is unrealistic, since it takes too simple a view of 
  the talents of men and of the circumstances which encourage, or cause, their development. And it is vicious, since the 
attempt to enforce the rules will undoubtedly erect barriers to what men might have been, and will reduce our humanity by 
increasing our professional qualifications." Paul Feyerabend (1970)  </font>

</p> From Peter Hall's 2011 IMS Presidential Address. "Robert Adler, John Ewing and Peter Taylor, expressed concern about the use of 
citation data for assessing research performance. Their report, published in Statistical Science in 2009, noted that: There is a 
belief that citation statistics are inherently more accurate because they substitute simple numbers for complex judgments, and 
hence overcome the possible subjectivity of peer review." </font>

From Karl Popper...

It is easy to obtain confirmations, or verifications, for nearly every theory-if we look for confirmations. 
Confirmations should count only if they are the result of risky predictions; that is to say, if, unenlightened by the theory in question, we should 
have expected an event which was incompatible with the theory--an event which would have refuted the theory. 
Every 'good' scientific theory is a prohibition: it forbids certain things to happen. The more a theory forbids, the better it is. 
A theory which is not refutable by any conceivable event is nonscientific. Irrefutability is not a virtue of a theory (as people often think) but a vice. 
Every genuine test of a theory is an attempt to falsify it, or to refute it. Testability is falsifiability; but there are degrees of testability: some 
theories are more testable, more exposed to refutation, than others; they take, as it were, greater risks. 
Confirming evidence should not count except when it is the result of a genuine test of the theory; and this means that it can be presented as a serious 
but unsuccessful attempt to falsify the theory. (I now speak in such cases of 'corroborating evidence'.)  Some genuinely testable theories, when found to 
be false, are still upheld by their admirers--for example by introducing ad hoc some auxiliary assumption, or by re-interpreting the theory ad hoc in such a 
way that it escapes refutation. Such a procedure is always possible, but it rescues the theory from refutation only at the price of destroying, or at 
least lowering, its scientific status. (I later described such a rescuing operation as a 'conventionalist twist' or a 'conventionalist stratagem'.) 
One can sum up all this by saying that the criterion of the scientific status of a theory is its falsifiability, or refutability, or testability.
