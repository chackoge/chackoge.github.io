"The idea that science can and should be run according to some fixed rules, and that its rationality consists in agreement with such rules, is both unrealistic and vicious. It is unrealistic, since it takes too simple a view of the talents of men and of the circumstances which encourage, or cause, their development. And it is vicious, since the attempt to enforce the rules will undoubtedly erect barriers to what men might have been, and will reduce our humanity by increasing our professional qualifications." Paul Feyerabend (1970)  </font>
